What's happening with the American economy right now?
A strange confluence of factors—a prolonged labor shortage, supply chain disruptions, and chaos in the energy market—makes it hard to predict where the U.S. economy is heading. Economist Laurence Ball discusses what factors influence rising inflation and what could trigger a recession.

It's the best of times and it's the worst of times. It's the U.S. economy in 2022.

On one hand, unemployment is at near historic lows, job growth is strong, and consumer spending robust. Viewed 
through these lenses alone, the future looks bright. But alas, there's a pernicious visitor back from the 1970s and 
early '80s: high inflation. Consumers see this most at the gas pump. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has roiled 
energy markets leaving many Americans paying more than $5 a gallon for gas. Add in pandemic-related supply chain 
disruptions and goods shortages related to factories shuttered for lockdowns, and our sunny financial skies face some 
headwinds. 

In the middle of this potentially gathering storm is the Federal Reserve, trying to rein in the economy's excesses 
without causing pain of its own. Economists once predicted that our post-pandemic economy would resemble the Roaring 
'20s, and now a different "R" word is being bandied about: recession. 

Suffice it to say, it's a curious time to be an economist, as economics Professor Laurence Ball well knows.

"It's very difficult, if not basically impossible, to predict when recessions are going to happen," Ball says. "The 
economy kind of cruises along and takes care of itself, and then something completely unexpected happens to knock it 
off. Obviously, COVID in 2020 is an extreme example of that. But what's notable about this period relative to the 
last 40 years or so is the high inflation. Now, inflation does not directly cause a recession. But the Fed's efforts 
to control inflation by raising interest rates could cause one." 

For more insights into the precarious state of the U.S. economy, the Hub reached out to Ball, who shared what 
measures he looks at when assessing the nation's economic health and why he's hesitant to make predictions. 

We last saw high inflation back when Nixon and Carter were in the White House. What's causing it now? Largely the 
things that a lot of people are talking about in the media, like the strange labor shortages which we've probably all 
experienced, such as at restaurants where they are not getting enough workers. The labor shortage pushes wages up, 
which at first blush sounds like a good thing, but then it gets passed through onto prices. The high energy prices 
are obviously because of international events, and then there are all the strange supply shortages, such as the 
shortage of computer chips that led to a big increase in used car prices. These latter idiosyncratic factors will 
presumably go away. Then it's the question of whether the labor shortage will ease or whether the Fed has to really 
step in and potentially cause a recession or not. 

Presidents are quick to take credit for strong economies and the first to be blamed for recessions, but how much 
power does the president really have in all this? Not very much. I guess the administration's big fiscal stimulus 
presumably plays a role in the economy being very strong to the point of maybe too strong right now. I suppose if 
there were a massive tax increase to take away all the stimulus checks, that might make a difference—but that's 
obviously not happening. Beyond that, it's basically up to a combination of luck and what the Federal Reserve does. 
It's an awkward time to be in the administration because politically, they can't really say, 'We can't control this 
so let's just hope for the best.' They have to act as though they're doing something, when there's not really much 
they can. 

The economy has so many metrics and moving parts. What are some data points you look at? The big item, which could be 
a cause for optimism or not, is the behavior of "inflation expectations." This is the rate at which consumers and 
businesses expect prices to rise in the future. The nightmare is going back to the 1970s when inflation just spiraled 
up and up. Once people expect inflation, it's self-fulfilling, because if you're a business expecting inflation, 
you think, 'Better raise prices to keep up with inflation.' And then if you're a worker, you think, 'Better make sure 
to get a wage increase to keep up with inflation.' This just causes inflation to continue. 

The quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters is my favorite measure of inflation expectations. For the second 
quarter of 2022, their long-term inflation forecast, which is a prediction of the inflation rate over 10 years' time, 
went from about 2% to about 2.3%. This could just a little bit of noise or a random variation, but it could also be 
the beginnings of something troubling. We're really at a critical point. I'm going to be having a sleepless night in 
August before the next number comes out. If it goes up to 2.6 and then next to 2.9, it would be worrying. Once people 
start expecting somewhat higher inflation, then it gets very difficult to wring out of the system and the Fed might 
have to be nastier about what it does to the economy. 

So, would you hazard a guess as to where we're heading? It's just so hard to say. You can go on Twitter right now and 
find all sorts of experts saying this will happen or that will happen. I would say I'm getting kind of nervous. I 
should add for background, that just over a year ago when [former Treasury Secretary] Larry Summers was getting a lot 
of attention talking about inflation being a big problem, I wrote a paper with some economists in the International 
Monetary Fund on what's going on with inflation. It was a great paper, well-researched and persuasive. And it showed, 
conclusively, that it was all a transitory phenomenon, and it was going to go away soon. That turned out to be, 
within four to six months, wildly inaccurate. I'm a little bit scarred by that experience and reluctant to predict. 
You can just put me down as getting nervous. """

ca = """The Bank of Canada is likely to hike its benchmark interest rate another half a percentage point on June 1, 
further raising the cost of borrowing to tackle “persistent” inflation levels not seen in 30 years, economists predict. 


Economists who spoke to Global News all said they expect the central bank’s key interest rate to rise to 1.5 per cent 
on Wednesday. 

Money markets are also pricing in a hike of 50 basis points, economists confirmed.

Such a move would make the second consecutive jump of 50 basis points from the central bank. The last time it raised 
rates half a percentage point in back-to-back decisions was nearly 25 years ago, in December 1997 and January 1998. 

Benjamin Reitzes, Canadian rates and macro strategist at BMO Capital Markets, told Global News that the hike is 
expected due to inflation figures remaining high through the first half of 2022. 

The 6.8 per cent inflation rate recorded last month was well above the Bank of Canada’s inflation forecast released 
at the start of April, which pegged year-over-year price growth around six per cent in the second quarter of the year. 

Gas prices are among the areas expected to keep climbing in May, he noted, giving the Bank of Canada plenty of cause 
for concern in efforts to tamp down on the surging cost of living. 

“Inflation is still the main story here. The Bank of Canada wants to push back on inflation and they do that by 
raising rates,” he said. 

Inflation is beating initial expectations in part because of the prolonged war in Ukraine, according to TD Bank 
senior economist James Orlando. 

Early in the conflict, economists had expected a “temporary spike” in prices due to gas and food supply chain 
constraints, but impacts three months into the war are “broader” and “much more persistent than previously thought,
” Orlando explained. COVID-19 lockdowns in China contributing to global supply chain issues are among other factors. 

Other central banks are also in a rate hike cycle, with the U.S. Federal Reserve also taking a half-percentage-point 
step in early May. 

Is a 75 bps hike in the cards? Though the consensus for Wednesday’s decision is gathering around the 50-basis-point 
mark, economists who spoke to Global News said a more aggressive increase of 75 basis points is not out of the 
question. 

Tu Nguyen, economist with RSM Canada, said that while back in January the idea of such a jump would have been 
inconceivable, today it’s “certainly possible.” 

Nguyen thinks the 75-basis-point move is unlikely, however, to avoid the risk of a more steep economic decline.

“I think the bank would stick with the 50-basis-point hike. They don’t want to scare the economy too much,” she said.

Reitzes agreed, saying a 75-basis-point increase would be a “more extreme move” that wouldn’t be in line with the 
central bank’s messaging on interest rates to date. 

While the Bank of Canada is keen to take steam out of the country’s roaring economy, two rate hikes at the start of 
the year have already had a cooling effect on sectors such as the housing market, where home sales are slowing and 
prices are showing declines in some cities. 

Orlando said the real estate market has “done a 180” from just a few months back when buyers were rushing to get in 
before prices rose, to today when Canadians are sitting on the sidelines seeing how low prices could go. 

When will rate hikes stop? The current benchmark rate of one per cent is still stimulating the economy, 
Orlando noted, and the central bank itself said earlier this year that rates need to rise to the two-to-three per 
cent range before the bank’s monetary policy would truly be taking its foot off the gas. 

He predicts another 50-basis-point increase in July to bring the bank’s rate to two per cent, with another hike 
likely in September. 

Reitzes predicted the same and said the bank will likely take stock of the impact of rising rates on inflation and 
the economy in the fall. 

Nguyen also expects the Bank of Canada will continue to raise rates through September as the bank has some “wiggle 
room” to increase its rate without seriously risking a recession in Canada’s “overheated economy.” 

The Bank of Canada will use that runway to raise rates as it looks to maintain its “credibility” as an 
inflation-fighting central bank, Orlando said. 

If it does not use its primary policy tool to push back on inflation, expectations of perpetual price growth could 
seep into the minds of consumers and businesses. If sentiment shifts and inflation is expected long term, 
workers will push for higher wages and businesses will plan to pass those elevated costs on to consumers, forming an 
endless cycle of inflation. 

“If people believe that the Bank of Canada is going to be successful in reining in inflation in the future … it 
enables the Bank of Canada to be more effective at doing that job,” Orlando said. 

The latest consumer and business outlook surveys from the Bank of Canada in early April showed that while inflation 
expectations remain high in the short term, Canadians remain confident pressures will ease in the longer term. 

“The good news is that belief is still out there that this is going to be something that will eventually be reined 
in,” Orlando said. """

Japan's Digitalization Can Add Momentum for Economic Rebound
By Piyaporn Sodsriwiboon, Purva Khera, and Rui Xu

June 1, 2022

The Japanese economy is recovering from the pandemic as related uncertainty and supply constraints subside and 
consumption gradually rebounds. 

Growth will accelerate to 2.4 percent this year, the fastest in 12 years, and maintain nearly the same pace next 
year, according to our latest economic projections in April. 

Our recent assessment of the world’s third-largest economy credits strong policy support and high vaccination levels. 
Pent-up consumer demand will help support the expansion. 

However, the war in Ukraine following a continuing pandemic pose substantial risks to the near-term outlook. The 
economy also faces longer-term headwinds from an aging and shrinking population, stagnant productivity growth and 
major climate change risks. 

Japan’s many challenges highlight the importance of efforts to enhance growth that can foster inclusion, 
reduce inequality, and ensure a sustainable future. Our study shows that scaling up digital investment, along with 
full implementation of growth-enhancing reforms that increase labor supply and productivity, could boost gross 
domestic product. 

Digitalization, importantly, could provide additional growth momentum. The pandemic underscored Japan’s uneven 
embrace of technology. Even though it’s one of the world’s biggest users of industrial robots and home of a major 
electronics industry, it still lags other economies in adoption of digitalization by businesses (for example, 
continued reliance on legacy IT systems), government, and the financial sector. 

This structural weakness was further underscored by how many employers struggled to make the shift to remote work 
when the pandemic began, reducing economic output and sapping productivity at a crucial time. Paper-based procedures 
hindered government responses to the outbreak, delaying the 2020 emergency cash program that aided consumers. 
Adoption of cashless payments and e-commerce have also lagged. 

Accordingly, faster digital transformation with government support would boost productivity and growth. For example, 
lawmakers last year abolished most of the authorization of documents by Hanko seals, the personalized ink stamps used 
for centuries in Japan and similar to those in other Asian nations. 

This pivot to electronic signatures from traditional stamps is an important one because it allows for digitalizing 
administrative procedures that make government more efficient. 

Other initiatives include the Digital Agency, a body established in September under the cabinet to speed 
digitalization of central and local governments and the private sector. 

To ensure that this transition is inclusive, policy support should be carefully designed to mitigate any potential 
harm for unskilled workers. Other key priorities in accelerating adoption of digital financial services include 
enhancing public trust by augmenting financial and digital literacy; improving connectivity between different 
cashless payment platforms; and strengthening data privacy, consumer protection, and cybersecurity. 

Greater digitalization, however, will be best if it’s also combined with other growth-enhancing reforms that are 
important to address Japan’s demographic headwinds. 

Bringing more female, older, and foreign workers into the labor force should be a priority. Increasing training and 
career opportunities for those without lifetime employment, who are mostly women, will help raise productivity and 
wages. Better corporate governance and reduced regulation would boost productivity and investment. 

Looking ahead, Japan would need not only stronger growth, but also growth that is environmentally sustainable. Our 
study suggests a profound economic transformation built on significant green investments and more reliance on carbon 
pricing would further support a recovery from the pandemic, while creating a new and clean economic engine for the 
future. Japan’s commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 is therefore an important and positive step. 

Together, these policy objectives show how Japan can make the most of the disruptions from the pandemic to push 
through reforms that lift productivity and economic growth. """

China's economy is looking brighter but it's not in the clear yet

Hong Kong (CNN Business)From big gains in tech stocks to robust trade data, China has had plenty of good news on the 
economic front this week. 

The positive developments come after the world's second largest economy was battered by widespread Covid lockdowns, 
a sweeping crackdown on tech companies and a real estate slump. Consumer spending and factory output both shrank 
sharply in April, while unemployment has surged to the highest level since the initial coronavirus outbreak in early 
2020. As China takes steps to gradually reopen businesses, and authorities introduce a slew of measures to stimulate 
activity, there are signs that a revival may be around the corner. Still, analysts say more needs to be done to 
repair investor confidence in China, and some big risks haven't gone away. "It will take time to repair the business 
confidence, and sell-offs in Chinese assets might resume if China data proved to be disappointing again," said Ken 
Cheung, chief Asian foreign exchange strategist for Mizuho Bank. 

Didi's shares climbed 24% Monday on Wall Street after the report. Other media reports this week have signaled an 
easing of the crackdown. On Thursday, Bloomberg said Chinese regulators have started early stage discussions on a 
potential revival of Ant Group's IPO, citing people familiar with the matter. Reuters reported on Thursday that Ant — 
owner of the hugely popular Alipay app — aims to file a preliminary prospectus for the offering as soon as next 
month. Jack Ma was about to make history with a planned $37 billion IPO of the Alibaba affiliate in Shanghai and Hong 
Kong in November 2020. But China abruptly halted the Ant deal days before the stock was due to start trading, 
a move that marked the start of a regulatory offensive that engulfed the internet industry in the year that followed. 

Ant Group said Thursday that it "currently doesn't have any plan to initiate an IPO." The China Securities Regulatory 
Commission added that it has not conducted any research work regarding a new Ant IPO. Alibaba (BABA) shares have been 
whipsawed by the news but are still up 18% this week on Wall Street. In Hong Kong, meanwhile, the stock has risen for 
five straight sessions and is up 22% this week — the best weekly performance since Alibaba's secondary listing there 
in 2019. The Chinese government has brought further relief to the tech sector in recent weeks. Regulators have said 
that they would support overseas listings of tech companies. And on Tuesday, authorities issued 60 new game licenses 
following a months-long freeze. Tencent (TCEHY), China's largest gaming firm, soared more than 6% after the news. The 
Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks the 30 largest Chinese tech stocks in Hong Kong, is up 10% this week. Trade 
improves China also released strong trade data for the month of May, after a slump in April. The country's exports 
jumped 16.9% in May from a year ago, compared with only 3.9% growth in April. Imports, meanwhile, rose for the first 
time in three months. "The increase in both exports and imports was mainly due to the reopening of the port of 
Shanghai, China's largest port, in the last week of May," said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING 
Group. Shanghai had been under a strict lockdown since late March, forcing factories to close and causing significant 
shipping delays. 

Congestion at the Shanghai port is almost "back to normal," VesselsValue, a shipping data firm, said earlier this 
week. Average waiting times have now shortened to 28 hours, compared to 66 hours in late April. On Wednesday, 
Premier Li Keqiang urged local government officials to help smooth transportation and logistics and protect supply 
chains. China would strive to achieve reasonable economic growth in the second quarter and reduce unemployment, 
he said, reiterating previous calls. Last week, the State Council, the country's cabinet, unveiled a new package of 
33 stimulus measures to shore up growth, including tens of billions of dollars of additional tax cuts and 
infrastructure spending. Is this enough? But analysts remain cautious. The May trade data does not change "the 
consensus view that China's trade surplus is going to narrow," as demand for Chinese exports weakens because of a 
slowing global economy, HSBC analysts said Thursday. Earlier this week, the World Bank warned that stagflation risks 
are rising in the global economy. It now expects global growth to slump from 5.7% in 2021 to 2.9% in 2022, 
significantly lower than 4.1% that was anticipated in January. Global inflation, meanwhile, is likely remain above 
target in many economies, the bank said. HSBC analysts said that Beijing's investment push in infrastructure and 
property is set to increase China's commodity imports, adding to its inflation problems. "As commodity prices remain 
elevated, these imports will be costly for China," they said. 

China's adherence to a policy of tough Covid restrictions also remains a significant risk. President Xi Jinping said 
Wednesday that the country must stick "unswervingly" to its zero-Covid strategy, while urging officials to bolster 
the economy, according to state-owned Xinhua News Agency. A growing number of neighborhoods in Shanghai face another 
temporary lockdown this weekend, as authorities launch mass testing days after Covid restrictions were eased for most 
of its 25 million residents. Authorities in Beijing's largest Chaoyang district also announced Thursday the closure 
of all entertainment venues, just days after allowing their reopening. "Markets have naively assumed that China was 
one and done with Beijing and Shanghai," said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Oanda, on Thursday. 
"Covid-zero is going nowhere in China, and nor is the virus. Thus, the chances of extended restrictions returning, 
with the ensuing drop in China's economic activity, remain as high as ever," he added. — CNN's Beijing bureau 
contributed to this report. """

UK economy ‘only going to get worse’ as growth slowdown begins

LONDON — A growth slowdown is underway in the U.K. after the economy shrank by 0.1% in March, with economists 
expecting further contractions this year. 

Although the economy grew 0.8% for the first quarter as a whole, slightly below consensus forecasts for 1% growth, 
January was the only positive month of the quarter. The war in Ukraine and subsequent supply chain problems and 
energy price spikes have compounded the toll of inflation, which is running at a multi-decade high. 

Sterling hit a two-year low versus the U.S. dollar following the data as traders digested growing uncertainty about 
the U.K.’s economic outlook. 

The surprise monthly contraction in March — economists had expected the figure to come in flat — presents a worry for 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government as the country’s cost-of-living crisis is yet to reach its peak. 

“Ultimately, things are only going to get worse for consumers. Energy bills are expected to soar again later this 
year when the price cap is reassessed, while inflation is proving stickier than expected,” said Hinesh Patel, 
portfolio manager at Quilter Investors. 

U.K inflation hit a 30-year high of 7% in March and in April, the country’s energy regulator increased its price cap 
by 54% to accommodate soaring prices. In the Queen’s Speech to mark the state opening of parliament on Wednesday, 
the government promised to focus on economic growth in order to address the spiraling cost of living. 

Patel added that the Bank of England now faces a “near impossible task of managing the economy out of this quagmire.”

“They are in aggressive rate raising mode for now, but this cannot remain the case for long given the economic issues 
already starting to play out,” he added. 

The Bank of England has hiked interest rates at four consecutive policy meetings as it looks to rein in inflation, 
and markets are pricing in another five hikes by spring of 2023. 

However, James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, suggested that the central bank’s more cautious tone in 
recent weeks indicates that it will not meet these expectations, and may settle for a couple more hikes before 
hitting pause so as not to exert further downward pressure on economic growth. 

Thursday’s GDP figures also showed that the U.K.’s dominant consumer-facing services industry took a substantial hit 
in March, falling 1.8% as consumer spending declined amid the squeeze on households. 

Health spending to fall away ING’s Smith said a second consecutive decline in output should be expected in April, 
coinciding with the end of free Covid-19 testing. 

“Surprisingly, health output actually increased in March despite the ongoing wind-down of Covid-related activities, 
but clearly, that’s unlikely to last,” Smith noted. 

“Health spending has been a key driver of GDP through the pandemic, and in fact, the overall size of the economy 
would be around 1% smaller had output in this sector stayed flat since early-2020.” 

Caroline Simmons, U.K. chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, was also cautious looking ahead.

“There is growing potential for U.K. GDP to be negative in the second quarter, which is in part due to the consumer 
squeeze from energy price rises,” she said. 

U.K. stocks insulated As concerns about the growth outlook in the coming quarters grow, investors are also 
considering the impact it could have on markets. 

However, Simmons noted that the U.K. economy is not representative of the U.K. equity market. UBS sees upside to the 
FTSE 100 index with a December target of 8,100; the FTSE was trading around 7172 mid-morning Thursday. 

Importantly for the U.K., both labor demand and business investment intentions remain firm, reducing the risk of a 
sharp downturn in overall growth, according to Daniel Casali, chief investment strategist at Tilney Smith & Williamson. 

The Bank of England expects growth to be flat in the second quarter, though Casali also noted that there is potential 
for a modest contraction. 

“For investors, given that the large cap U.K.-listed companies derive the bulk of their sales abroad, it really is 
global growth that matters,” Casali added. 

The IMF recently reduced its global growth forecast to 3.6% for 2022 and 2023, from 6.1% last year.

“Along with the sharp EPS gains made by the energy sector, the outlook for UK company profits has improved. The 
consensus forecasts 15% Earnings Per Share growth for 2022, a big pick-up from just under 3% at the start of the 
year,” Casali added. 

“At the very least, rising company earnings (and cheap valuations) should limit U.K. equity downside in current 
volatile market conditions.” """
